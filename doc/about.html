<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/StartupWeekend/googleio_contest">Startup Weekend Operations and Organizers Portal</a> (SWOOP) dataset I scraped every Startup Weekend (SW) event's webpage for the past year and used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a> methods to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model">generative models</a> based on the language used. I've then used these models to create not-so-random gibberish.</p>
<p>In order to create this page I've used <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Google Dart</a>, which is easy enough to both learn and use within 24 hours and also compiles down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. Moreover in order to compress the HTML/CSS/JS resources as much as possible I've used the <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/compress-data-more-densely-with-zopfli.html">Zopfli algorithm</a> developed by Google Software Engineer Lode Vandevenne, via the <a href="http://zlib.net/pigz/">pigz</a> command-line tool.</p>
